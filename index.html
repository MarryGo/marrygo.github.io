                <br>
                Wednesday Addams is expelled from her school after dumping live piranhas into the school's pool in
                retaliation for the
                boys' water polo team bullying her brother Pugsley. Consequently, her parents Gomez and Morticia Addams
                enroll her at
                their high school alma mater Nevermore Academy, a private school for monstrous outcasts, in the town of
                Jericho,
                Vermont. Wednesday's cold, emotionless personality and her defiant nature make it difficult for her to
                connect with her
                schoolmates and cause her to run afoul of the school's principal Larissa Weems. However, she discovers
                she has inherited
                her mother's psychic abilities which allow her to solve a local murder mystery.
